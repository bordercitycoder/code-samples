# David McKinnon's Code Samples

 

The code samples in this repo are bundled into an Android App called PayDave.  This code is meant to be reviewed by perspective employers.
This code also contains experiments with newer Android features I have not been able to use on the job.  

  - This code contains 
  -     a fragment with a presenter and model
  -     a fragment with a view model and model
  -     retrofit calls to a mock endpoint on aws
  -     primarily java but also some kotlin code
  
  See this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/bordercitycoder/code-samples/wiki) for details.
