# Code Samples

 

The code samples in this repo are bundled into an Android app.  This code is meant to be reviewed by perspective employers.
This code also contains experiments with newer Android features I have not been able to use on the job.  
  
  See this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/bordercitycoder/code-samples/wiki) for details.
